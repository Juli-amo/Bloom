# 🌸 Bloom  
### Interactive 2D Environmental Storytelling Game

**Bloom** is an interactive 2D storytelling experience set in a living, evolving ecosystem.

Players nurture plants, expand their technological capabilities, and observe how their decisions influence the environment. Over time, beauty, efficiency, industrialization, and invasive growth begin to reshape the world.

Without using written dialogue, Bloom explores themes of:

- Sustainability  
- Technological ambition  
- Ecological balance  
- Greed and consequence  

Every action leaves a trace.  
The player ultimately chooses between preservation, acceleration, or restoration.

## 🌿 Design Philosophy

Bloom is built around **systemic storytelling**:

- Growth reflects player intention.
- Automation increases efficiency but impacts biodiversity.
- Visual changes represent narrative consequences.
- Sound design reinforces environmental shifts.
